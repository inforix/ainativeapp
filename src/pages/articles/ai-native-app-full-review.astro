						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							The software development landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Traditional applications that bolt on AI features as an afterthought are being superseded by AI Native Applications—software systems designed from the ground up with artificial intelligence as their foundational layer. This shift represents more than just a technological upgrade; it's a paradigm change that redefines how we conceptualize, architect, and deploy intelligent software solutions.
						</p>

						<h2>What Are AI Native Applications?</h2>
						<p>
							AI Native Applications are software systems where artificial intelligence is not merely a feature but the core architectural component around which the entire application is built. Unlike traditional applications that integrate AI capabilities as secondary functions, AI-native systems are fundamentally designed to think, learn, and adapt.
						</p>

						<h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Intelligence-First Architecture:</strong> AI capabilities are embedded at the infrastructure level, not added as middleware or plugins</li>
							<li><strong>Adaptive User Experience:</strong> The application learns from user behavior and continuously adapts its interface and functionality</li>
							<li><strong>Predictive Capabilities:</strong> Systems anticipate user needs and system requirements before they're explicitly requested</li>
							<li><strong>Autonomous Decision Making:</strong> The application can make intelligent decisions without human intervention while maintaining appropriate oversight</li>
							<li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Performance and accuracy improve over time through experience and data accumulation</li>
